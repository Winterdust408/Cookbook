Ingredients:

1 premade gram cracker pie crust (the kind you don't have to cook)
1 cp heavy cream (whipping cream adequate)
1 bag chocolate chips, ~12 oz
1/4 cp coconut oil (quantity when melted)
2 tsp alcohol based extract (orange, mint, raspberry, vanilla, coffee, w/e. The alcohol is important to the consistency of the pie)

Equipment:

microwave safe mixing bowl (I use a large glass liquid measure with a spout)
small microwave safe dish
whisk
spatula
table knife
fridge

Optional:

cereal bowl
small spoon


Directions:

Pour cream into mixing bowl, heat in microwave until it starts to bubble. ~1min or more in my previous ancient underpowered microwave, less on a newer machine.

With the table knife, chisel out the coconut oil into the small dish, heat until completely melted. ~3min with my old microwave.

While waiting for your oil to become liquid, gradually add the chocolate chips in small batches to the hot cream, stirring with the whisk. I put the chocolate chips in a cereal bowl and add them with the spoon*. I wait until each batch of chips has melted at least some before adding more. If the chocolate chips stop melting, reheat mixing bowl in the microwave.

Stir in coconut oil. You can do this at any point while adding chocolate, it will heat it up.

Toward the end, add the extract.

Pour mixture into the pie crust with aid of the spatula and let set in the fridge for a few hours.

Serve in small slices, It's rich.
