I got this recipe from the sister of one of my exes. Sadly I no longer have access to the email address with the original, this is from a version I copied to an index card stuck on the fridge for many years. I can tell it's old b/c I only wrote in cursive when I was still having problems with carpal tunnel.

8 ripe peaches*
juice of one lemon
ground cinnamon
ground nutmeg
60 g 1/2 cp white whole wheat or all purpose flour
106 g (1/2 cp packed) brown sugar
225 g 1 stick butter
23 g 1/4 cp quick cooking oats

pie pan or brownie dish
lemon juicing supplies
small bowl

- Preheat oven to 375Â°

- butter baking dish

- cut up peaches and place in dish
- sprinkle with lemon juice
- sprinkle with cinnamon and nutmeg (I like to grate them over the top)

- in a small bowl, combine flour, sugar, and butter
- add oats
- add to baking dish by flinging small chunks on top.

- bake 25 minutes or until topping starts to crisp.


I usually use 6 peaches and make up the difference with blackberries, which is an improvement, but I'm not sure how to express how many. I think the original, and maybe when I first tasted it, had blackberries.
