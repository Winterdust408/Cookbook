Why yes I am using version control software to write a cookbook. In part bc I think it's funny to make updates to recipes in the language of bug reports, but also I wanted a place to show them to people and it might as well be here! 

Note this is a work in progress! Some of these are directly copied from other sources and are labeled as the source coming from someone else.

These are mostly things I've made at least ten times.

Ones marked with an asterisk* are the best as rated by other people telling me (or the person I got it from) they liked it.
