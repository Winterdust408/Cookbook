Why yes I am using version control software to write a cookbook. In part bc I think it's funny to make updates in the language of bug reports, but also so I have a place to show people if the ask.

These are mostly things I've made at least ten times.

Ones marked with an asterisk are the best as rated by other people telling me they liked it.
