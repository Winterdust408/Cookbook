What one of my former roommates, who was Russian, called "salad"; in his brain this and bread went with almost every meal. His version could be as simple as coarsely chopped tomato and salt.

Ingredients:

1-2 ripe tomatoes
1/2 red onion
1/2 cucumber
1/4 cup cilantro or (optional)
~1/4 tsp (or less) salt
a few twists fresh ground pepper (optional)
~ 1/4 tsp thyme (optional)
1-2 splashes rice vinegar

Instructions:

Thinly slice tomatoes, cucumber, and red onion. 

Coarsely chop celantro.

Add all ingredients to bowl with seasoning and mix together.

It's best if you give the flavors time to combine before serving.

variant: sub 2 green onions for red onions, or add them redundantly.
variant: sub parsley for cilantro.
